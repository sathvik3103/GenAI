            "ChatCompletionMessage(content=\"The sentiment on Swiggy's IPO listing price in the Indian stock market seems to be mixed, based on recent discussions and analyses:\\n\\n1. **High Valuation Concerns**: Some market observers are skeptical about Swiggy's high valuation, which was last reported to be seeking around $10.7 billion. There's a concern that this might lead to a lower listing price or a less enthusiastic response from investors, especially given the recent performance of other tech IPOs like Zomato, which has seen significant fluctuations in its stock price post-listing.\\n\\n2. **IPO Timing**: Discussions around the timing of Swiggy's IPO indicate that there might be some uncertainty or delay. This uncertainty could affect investor sentiment negatively as waiting too long might make the IPO less attractive if market conditions change or if investor interest wanes.\\n\\n3. **Comparison with Competitors**: Swiggy's valuation and potential listing price are often compared with Zomato. Given Zomato's experience, there's caution among investors about overpaying for food delivery stocks, which might temper expectations for Swiggy's IPO.\\n\\n4. **Market Volatility**: The general market sentiment towards IPOs has been cautious due to volatility in the stock market. Investors are becoming more selective, focusing on profitability, sustainable business models, and growth prospects rather than just growth at all costs.\\n\\n5. **Optimism**: Despite the concerns, there are also voices of optimism. Swiggy has shown growth, and if they can demonstrate a path to profitability, some investors believe it could still command a good listing price. There's also mention of Swiggy's potential to expand into other verticals, which could justify a higher valuation.\\n\\n6. **Insider Information**: There's a tweet suggesting that someone close to Swiggy's management believes the company is targeting a listing price that reflects its growth and market potential, indicating internal confidence in achieving a favorable valuation.\\n\\nIn summary, while there is excitement about Swiggy's potential, there's also a significant amount of caution due to its high valuation, the performance of similar companies post-IPO, and general market conditions. Investors seem to be waiting for clearer signals on Swiggy's financial health, growth strategy, and market conditions before making definitive judgments on what the IPO listing price might be.\", refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None)\n"
